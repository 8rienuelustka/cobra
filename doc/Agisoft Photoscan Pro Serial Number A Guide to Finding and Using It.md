- If you have activated your license in Photoscan Pro 1.3.4 or later, or in Metashape Pro 1.4 or later, you can find the last section of your serial number in the .lic file that is located in the installation folder of the software[^1^] [^2^]. For example, if your serial number is PS-PRO-1234567890-ABCDEFGH, the .lic file will contain ABCDEFGH.
- If you have activated your license in an earlier version of Photoscan Pro or Metashape Pro, you can send the .lic file that is located in the installation folder of the software to support@agisoft.com and they will check which serial number has been used[^1^] [^2^].
- If you have not activated your license yet, you can find your serial number in the confirmation email that you received from Agisoft after purchasing the software. You can also log in to your account on Agisoft website and check your order history.

## How to Use Agisoft Photoscan Pro
 
Agisoft Photoscan Pro is a software that allows you to create 3D models from a set of overlapping images. You can use it for various applications, such as photogrammetry, cultural heritage preservation, architecture, archaeology, and more. To use the software, you need to follow these general steps:

1. Import your images into the software. You can use any digital camera or smartphone to capture the images, as long as they have enough overlap and coverage of the object or scene you want to reconstruct. You can also use geotagged images or ground control points to improve the accuracy of your model.
2. Align your images and generate a sparse point cloud. The software will automatically detect and match the common features in your images and estimate their positions and orientations. You can also manually add or edit the tie points and camera parameters if needed.
3. Build a dense point cloud and a mesh. The software will use advanced algorithms to create a high-resolution point cloud and a polygonal mesh from your images. You can adjust the quality and resolution of your model according to your needs and preferences.
4. Generate a texture and export your model. The software will apply a realistic texture to your mesh based on your images. You can also edit the texture or apply filters to enhance your model. You can then export your model in various formats, such as OBJ, PLY, STL, PDF, etc.
