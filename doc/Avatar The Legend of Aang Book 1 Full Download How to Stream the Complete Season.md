## What is Avatar: The Legend of Aang?
 
Avatar: The Legend of Aang is an American animated series that aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. It was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who also served as executive producers along with Aaron Ehasz. The series is set in a fantasy world where some people can manipulate one of the four elements with a martial art called "bending". The world is divided into four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation and the Air Nomads. Each nation has its own culture, history and bending style.
 
The series follows the journey of Aang, the last surviving airbender and the current Avatar. The Avatar is a special bender who can learn all four elements and maintain balance in the world. However, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for 100 years while the Fire Nation waged a war against the other nations. He was awakened by Katara and Sokka, two siblings from the Southern Water Tribe, who became his friends and allies. Together, they travel across the world to help Aang master the other three elements and end the war.
 
The series is praised for its animation, story, characters, humor, cultural references and themes. It has won several awards and has been ranked as one of the best animated shows of all time by critics and fans. It has also spawned a sequel series called The Legend of Korra, which follows the next Avatar after Aang; a live-action film adaptation called The Last Airbender, which was widely criticized; and several comics and novels that expand on the story and characters.
