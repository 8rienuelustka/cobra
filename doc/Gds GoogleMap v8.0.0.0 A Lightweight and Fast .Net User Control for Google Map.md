It is a powerful and flexible .Net User Control that will save you time and effort in developing your mapping applications.
  
One of the main advantages of Gds GoogleMap v8.0.0.0 is that it supports various types of markers, such as legacy markers, new markers and icons. Legacy markers are the ones that you can see on the standard Google Map, such as char pins, dot pins, icon pins and text pins. New markers are the ones that Gds GoogleMap v8.0.0.0 provides, such as pin1, pin2, pin3 and pin4, which have different shapes, sizes, colors and labels. Icons are the ones that you can use to display any image on the map. You can use any combination of these markers to create your own custom markers and display them on the map.

Another advantage of Gds GoogleMap v8.0.0.0 is that it supports various types of shapes, such as polylines, polygons, circles and rectangles. You can use these shapes to draw lines, areas, circles and rectangles on the map. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of each shape, such as color, width, opacity, fill color, fill opacity and editable. You can also use these shapes to perform geometric operations and computations on the map, such as distance, area, intersection and union.
 
A third advantage of Gds GoogleMap v8.0.0.0 is that it supports heatmap layers. A heatmap layer is a layer that displays a color-coded representation of the intensity of data points on the map. You can use a heatmap layer to visualize the distribution and density of data points on the map. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of the heatmap layer, such as gradient colors, opacity and radius. You can also use a heatmap layer to perform data analysis and clustering on the map.
