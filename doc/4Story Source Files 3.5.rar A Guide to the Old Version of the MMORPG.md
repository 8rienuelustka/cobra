If you are interested in modifying or testing the game, you might want to download the source files for 4Story 3.5 and compile them using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003. The source files contain the code for the client, server, and tools of the game. However, compiling and running the source files is not a straightforward process and requires some steps and fixes.
 
In this article, we will show you how to compile and run 4Story 3.5 source files using the following resources:
 
- 4Story Source Files 3.5.rar[^1^] [^3^] [^4^] - This is a compressed file that contains the source files for 4Story 3.5.
- Server + Client: https://mega.nz/#!v0BRxLIR!kHMRajqzU...QYD0zxvxr-B2Dg[^1^] - This is a link to download the server and client files for 4Story 3.5.
- TIDHBuilder : Release.rar[^2^] - This is a tool that creates the \*.idh files for the client.
- TClientID.h : TClientID.rar[^2^] - This is a header file that contains some definitions for the client.
- TACCOUNT\_create\_issue.sql[^2^] - This is a SQL script that fixes an issue with the TACCOUNT table in the database.

Before you start, make sure you have Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 installed on your computer. You also need to have SQL Server 2008 or later installed and configured. You can use any edition of SQL Server, but we recommend using SQL Server Express for testing purposes.
