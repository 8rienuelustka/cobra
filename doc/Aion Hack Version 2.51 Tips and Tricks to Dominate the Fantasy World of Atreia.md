Aion is a popular MMORPG game that takes place in the fantasy world of Atreia, where players can choose between two factions: the Elyos and the Asmodians. The game features a variety of quests, dungeons, PvP battles, and a unique flight system that allows players to soar through the skies.
 
However, some players may find it hard to progress in the game, especially when it comes to earning Kinah (the in-game currency) and XP (the experience points). That's why some players resort to using hacks, bots, cheats, and exploits to gain an unfair advantage over others.

## What is Aion Classic?
 
Aion Classic is a new version of Aion that was launched in June 2021. It is based on the original version of the game that was released in 2009, with some adjustments and improvements. Aion Classic aims to bring back the nostalgia and excitement of the early days of Aion, when the game was more challenging and rewarding.

The level cap is 50, and the game has a subscription-based model that requires players to purchase Siel's Aura to access the game.

## How to Level Up Fast in Aion Classic?
 
Leveling up in Aion Classic can be a daunting task, especially if you are new to the game or if you are used to the faster pace of the current version of Aion. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you level up faster and easier in Aion Classic.
 
One of the most important things to do is to complete quests. Quests are the main source of XP in Aion Classic, and they also reward you with Kinah, items, and other benefits. You should always check your quest log and map for available quests, and try to complete them as soon as possible. You should also look for repeatable quests that can be done multiple times for extra XP.
 
Another thing to do is to join a group or a party. Grouping up with other players can make leveling up more fun and efficient, as you can share XP, loot, and buffs. You can also tackle harder quests and dungeons that would be impossible to solo. You can use the chat or the group finder tool to find other players who are looking for a group or a party.
 
A third thing to do is to use XP boosters. XP boosters are items that can increase your XP gain by a certain percentage for a limited time. You can get XP boosters from various sources, such as events, rewards, or the cash shop. You should use XP boosters wisely, and save them for when you are doing quests or dungeons that give a lot of XP.
